# Pong-Game
A simple pong game, created with the tkinter library.

Overview:
The Interactive Pong Game is a Python program designed to recreate the classic Pong experience in an interactive and visually appealing format. Leveraging the Tkinter library, the game creates a dynamic pop-up window where users can control one paddle using arrow keys, while the other paddle is autonomously controlled by the computer. This implementation adds an element of challenge and excitement to the timeless game of Pong.

Key Features:

Tkinter GUI Interface:
The program utilizes the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) in the form of a pop-up window. This window serves as the canvas for the Pong game, providing an interactive platform for user engagement.

Arrow Key Controls:
Users can control their paddle's horizontal movement using the arrow keys. This intuitive control scheme enhances the player's ability to strategically position their paddle and respond to the computer-controlled opponent.

Computer-Controlled Paddle:
The program incorporates an AI-driven opponent that autonomously controls the second paddle. This AI opponent adds a dynamic and challenging aspect to the game, keeping users engaged and requiring strategic gameplay.

Real-Time Ball Movement:
The game features a bouncing ball that moves in real-time, responding to interactions with the paddles. The physics of ball movement, including deflection and rebound, contribute to the authenticity of the Pong experience.

Score Tracking:
The program keeps track of the score, updating it in real-time as the ball passes the paddles. This feature adds a competitive element to the game, allowing users to compete against the computer-controlled opponent.

Interactive Pop-Up Window:
The Tkinter-based pop-up window provides a dedicated space for the Pong game, creating a visually distinct and immersive environment for users to enjoy the gameplay.

Technical Details:

Programming Language: The program is written in Python, utilizing the Tkinter library for GUI development.
Event-Driven Programming: Implements an event-driven paradigm to respond to user inputs, such as arrow key presses, and update the game state accordingly.
